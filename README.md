# Dining Philosophers Problem

## Introduction
The **Dining Philosophers Problem** is a classical synchronization problem in computer science, illustrating the challenges of avoiding deadlock and starvation in concurrent programming. Five philosophers sit around a circular table with five chopsticks. Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating. To eat, a philosopher needs to pick up both chopsticks adjacent to their seat. The challenge is to ensure that no philosopher starves and that no deadlock occurs.

## Problem Description
- **N philosophers** are seated around a circular table.
- Each philosopher thinks and eats.
- To eat, a philosopher must pick up both chopsticks adjacent to them (left and right).
- A philosopher can only eat when they have both chopsticks.
- After eating, a philosopher puts down both chopsticks and goes back to thinking.
  
The goal is to design a synchronization mechanism such that:
- No two philosophers can eat at the same time using the same chopsticks.
- The system avoids deadlock, ensuring that every philosopher gets a chance to eat.
- Philosophers do not starve (i.e., each philosopher eventually eats).

## Solution
The solution involves managing concurrent access to shared resources (the chopsticks) using various synchronization techniques, such as:
- Mutexes
- Semaphores
- Monitors
